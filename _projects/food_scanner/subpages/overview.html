  <h1>Problem Overview</h1>
  <p>Families experience several difficulties associated with shopping for meals, including staying under budget, finding food that accommodates everyone, accounting for dietary restrictions and food aversions, and planning a large enough variety of healthy meals to reduce cravings for less-healthy options. These challenges are complex for a single person, but tracking the preferences and goals of multiple family members can be a major struggle that could contribute to unhealthy diets in some families.</p>
  <h1>Solution Overview</h1>
  <p>We propse the Food Scanner app as a solution to these problems. A family-centric app with multiple facets for tracking food allergies and aversions, setting nutrition goals, finding and saving recipes, and tracking food consumption -- each of these with family overviews and specifics for family members, which can all be used to help meal-decision making in the future.  The core feature of this app is the scanning capability.  The app will allow users to scan nutrition labels in the store to quickly receive feedback about the food, especially information about allergies, goals, and recipe compatibility.  Scanning the receipt is also an option for simpler operation, and for incorporating budget concerns.</p>
